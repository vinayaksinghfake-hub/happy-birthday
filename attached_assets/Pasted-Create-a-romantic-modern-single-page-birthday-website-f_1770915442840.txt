Create a romantic, modern, single-page birthday website for my girlfriend Kshitija. The site must be fully mobile-first, responsive, and optimized for phones.

Theme & Style:

Soft romantic aesthetic with a subtle Bollywood-inspired vibe (elegant, cinematic, dreamy).

Use warm pastel gradients (blush pink, lavender, soft gold).

Smooth scroll animations and fade-in effects.

Add subtle floating hearts or sparkles animation in the background (light and classy, not too flashy).

Elegant typography: mix of a handwritten romantic font for headings and clean modern sans-serif for body text.

Sections (Single Page Layout):
1. Hero Section (Full Screen)

Background: soft gradient with floating sparkles.

Big heading:
“Happy Birthday, My Beautiful Kshitija ❤️”

Subheading:
“To the most talented, kind-hearted, Bollywood queen who codes like a genius and sings like magic.”

A romantic button: “Scroll for a Surprise ✨”

Add soft background instrumental music toggle (romantic Bollywood instrumental style).

2. Photo Gallery Section (4 Photos)

Display the 4 attached photos in:

A swipeable mobile carousel.

On desktop: elegant grid with hover glow effect.

Add small romantic captions under each photo like:

“Our favorite memory 💕”

“That smile I fell in love with”

“Bollywood heroine vibes ✨”

“My forever favorite moment”

3. About Her Section

Title: “Why You’re So Special”

Add sweet personalized text:

You shine like a Bollywood star.

You code like a queen — smart, focused, unstoppable.

Your singing melts my heart every time.

You inspire me every single day.

I’m so lucky to have you in my life.

Make this section elegant with animated text reveal.

4. Love Message Section

Title: “A Letter to You”

Include a heartfelt message:

“Kshitija,
On your special day, I just want you to know how deeply you are loved. You are my happiness, my peace, and my biggest blessing. Watching you chase your dreams, code your ideas into reality, and sing with so much passion makes me admire you even more. I promise to always stand beside you, support you, and celebrate you — today and forever. Happy Birthday, my love ❤️”
